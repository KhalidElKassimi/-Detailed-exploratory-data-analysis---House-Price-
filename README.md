"Detailed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on House Prices" involves a comprehensive examination and interpretation of a dataset related to house prices. This process typically includes the thorough exploration of various factors and features that might influence house prices, such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, and other relevant attributes. Through visualizations, statistical summaries, and correlation analyses, the goal is to uncover patterns, relationships, and insights within the data. EDA plays a crucial role in understanding the underlying structure of the dataset, identifying outliers, and informing subsequent steps in data preprocessing and modeling for tasks like predicting house prices.
